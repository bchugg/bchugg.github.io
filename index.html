				Hello! I have big ears and I'm addicted to podcasts. 
				I was much cuter as a child. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm currently an M.Sc. student at the <a rel='nofollow' href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a> 
				at Oxford. My research interests lie somewhere between stochastic networks, 
				biological computation and guiness, although I'm quickly falling in love with economics. I'm excited to be joining Stanford Law School next year as an empirical research fellow. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I spent the previous summer at <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/" rel='nofollow'>RIKEN AIP</a> 
				in Tokyo, where I was  lucky to work with <a href="http://www.prefield.com/index.html" rel='nofollow'>Dr. Maehara</a> 
				as part of the <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/discr_optimize/" rel='nofollow'>Discrete 
				Optimization Unit</a>. Here I spent most of my time confused about submodular stochastic optimization 
				problems. Prior to that, I spent several wonderful years at the  
			 	<a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" rel='nofollow'>University of British Columbia</a> studying mathematics and computer science.
			 	 While there, my confusion was distributed in approximately equal parts between
			 	 stochastic chemical reaction networks 
			 	 and subtopics in computational geometry. I was immensely fortunate to be 
			 	 supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~will/" rel='nofollow'>Will Evans</a> and  <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/" rel='nofollow'>Anne Condon</a>, 
			 	 who both abated my confusion on many occasions. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on computing in dynamic 
			 	 environments under uncertainty.
