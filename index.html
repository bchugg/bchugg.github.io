					Hello! I have big ears and I'm addicted to podcasts.
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm currently a research fellow at Stanford Law School's <a href="https://reglab.stanford.edu/" rel='nofollow'>Regulation, Evaluation, and Governance Lab.</a>
					Previously, I was a student at the <a rel='nofollow' href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a>
					at Oxford. Some of my work is <a href="papers.html">here.</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm sympathetic to <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/" rel='nofollow'>Effective Altruism</a>, and currently sit on Stanford EA's exec committee. If you'd like to know more about the community, please get in touch!

				<h3>An erratic bio</h3>
				<p>
					In 2018, I spent some time at <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/" rel='nofollow'>RIKEN AIP</a>
					in Tokyo, where I was  lucky to work with <a href="http://www.prefield.com/index.html" rel='nofollow'>Dr. Maehara</a>
					as part of the <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/discr_optimize/" rel='nofollow'>Discrete
					Optimization Unit</a>. I spent most of my time confused about submodular stochastic optimization
					problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prior to that, I spent several wonderful years at the
				 	<a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" rel='nofollow'>University of British Columbia</a> studying mathematics and computer science.
				 	 Here my confusion was distributed in approximately equal parts between
				 	 stochastic chemical reaction networks
				 	 and subtopics in computational geometry. I was immensely fortunate to be
				 	 supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~will/" rel='nofollow'>Will Evans</a> and  <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/" rel='nofollow'>Anne Condon</a>,
				 	 who both abated my confusion on many occasions. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on computing in dynamic
				 	 environments under uncertainty.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 	During my undergraduate I founded <a href="http://codethechange.ca/" ref='nofollow'>Code the Change UBC</a>, which is now its own foundation (and is much better run).
