					I'm lead research analyst at Stanford Law School's 
					Regulation, Evaluation, and Governance Lab (<a href="https://reglab.stanford.edu/" rel='nofollow'>RegLab</a>), where I design and evaluate algorithms for various problems in public policy. 
				</p>

				<p>On the side, I co-host the <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/" ref='nofollow'>Increments</a> podcast, where <a href="https://vmasrani.github.io/">Vaden Masrani</a> and I confuse ourselves and others about philosophy and science.
					Sometimes I <a href="writing.html">string words together</a> and post the result somewhere in public. And sometimes I yell about bad philosophy (including  mine) and offer mellow takes on <a href="https://twitter.com/BennyChugg" rel='nofollow'>twitter</a>.  
				</p>

				<p>You can contact me at benchugg@stanford.edu. </p>

				<h3>Research Interests</h3>
				<p>
					My primary interests involve developing robust sequential decision-making algorithms, particularly in settings where traditional assumptions are violated. 
					I try and straddle the borderlands between theory and practice, but I've also spent some time doing purely applied work (typically with a policy focus). 
					<br><br>

					I'm also interested in algorithm design and analysis more broadly, having previously done some work in graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic reaction networks.

				<h3>An erratic bio</h3>
				<p>
					Prior to Stanford, I was a grad student at the <a rel='nofollow' href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a>
					at Oxford, where I studied topics at the intersection of spectral graph theory and geometry. <a href="files/ox_thesis.pdf">Here</a> is my thesis on the subject.
				</p>

				<p>
					In 2018, I spent some time at <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/" rel='nofollow'>RIKEN AIP</a>
					in Tokyo, where I was  lucky to work with <a href="http://www.prefield.com/index.html" rel='nofollow'>Dr. Maehara</a>
					as part of the <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/discr_optimize/" rel='nofollow'>Discrete
					Optimization Unit</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					My undergraduate was spent at the
				 	<a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" rel='nofollow'>University of British Columbia</a> studying mathematics and computer science, where I was
				 	 immensely fortunate to be
				 	 supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~will/" rel='nofollow'>Will Evans</a> and  <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/" rel='nofollow'>Anne Condon</a>.

		<h3>Increments</h3> 

		<p>The podcast is mostly an attempt to break out of the academic echochamber and talk about things other than limit theorems and algorithmic performance. We have a few beers and chat about anything from <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/26" rel='nofollow'>moral philosophy</a>  and <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/22" rel='nofollow'>thought experiments</a>, to the <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/28" rel='nofollow'>philosophy of logic</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/32" rel='nofollow'>climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/23" rel='nofollow'>free will</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/24" rel='nofollow'>dualism</a>, and <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/15" rel='nofollow'>social media</a>.  
		We also have an ongoing series on <em>Conjectures and Refutations</em> by Karl Popper.
		</p> 

		<p>We're filling the two-academics-talk-about-everything-while-mildy-intoxicated shaped hole in your heart, a necessary part of any healthy society. No need to thank us. </p>
