			<h4>Hi, I'm Ben. I'm an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a> studying mathematics and computer science. I'm exceptionally fortunate to be supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~will/">Will Evans</a> for my thesis research, and by <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/">Anne Condon</a> for my research in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction_network_theory">Stochastic Chemical Reaction Network Theory</a>.</h4>
			<h4>I'm slightly too ambitious for my own good. Consequently, my research interests span a wide variety of topics. I'm interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry">computational geometry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm">randomized algorithms</a>, chemical reaction networks and the closely related model of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_protocol">population protocols</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submodular_set_function">submodular functions</a> and their applications, and algorithms in general. 
			</h4>
			<h4>More broadly, I'm interested in cross-disciplinary applications of computer science to health care, genomics and the non-profit sector. I'm the founder of <a href="https://codethechangeubc.org">Code the Change UBC</a>, an organization of students providing free software for non-profits who cannot afford it otherwise. We are a derivative of <a href="https://codethechange.org">Code the Change</a> at Stanford. I'm also the co-founder of the <a href="http://graceorphancare.org/">Friends of Grace Orphan Care Society</a>, a non-profit helping a small, locally run Malawian Orphan Care achieve sustainability. </h4>
