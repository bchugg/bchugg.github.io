					Hello! I have big ears and I'm addicted to podcasts. 
					I was much cuter as a child. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm currently an M.Sc. student at the <a rel='nofollow' href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a> 
					at Oxford. My research interests lie somewhere between graph theory, 
					algorithm design, and guiness&mdash;although I'm quickly falling in love with economics. I'm excited to be joining Stanford Law School next year as an empirical research fellow. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm a proponent of the general philosophy of <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/" rel='nofollow'>Effective Altruism</a> and sit on the committee of <a href="http://www.eaoxford.com/about-us" rel='nofollow'>EA Oxford</a>.

				<h3>Miscellany</h3>
				<p>
					Owing to the fact that I spend a significant portion of each day epically confused about some aspect of maths, I have my share of personal procrastination catalysts. Here is a list of 
					<ul>
						<li><a href="podcasts.html">podcasts</a> I find enjoyable;</li>
						<li>thought-provoking <a href="books.html">books and essays</a> in several vague and overlapping categories;</li>
						<li>free, online <a href="courses.html">courses</a> which have taught me something interesting.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>

				<p>A flood of miscellany to help ensure that you are less productive over the next few minutes than you would be otherwise:

				<h3>Bio</h3>
				<p>
					I spent the previous summer at <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/" rel='nofollow'>RIKEN AIP</a> 
					in Tokyo, where I was  lucky to work with <a href="http://www.prefield.com/index.html" rel='nofollow'>Dr. Maehara</a> 
					as part of the <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/discr_optimize/" rel='nofollow'>Discrete 
					Optimization Unit</a>. I spent most of my time confused about submodular stochastic optimization 
					problems. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Prior to that, I spent several wonderful years at the  
				 	<a href="https://www.ubc.ca/" rel='nofollow'>University of British Columbia</a> studying mathematics and computer science.
				 	 Here my confusion was distributed in approximately equal parts between
				 	 stochastic chemical reaction networks 
				 	 and subtopics in computational geometry. I was immensely fortunate to be 
				 	 supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~will/" rel='nofollow'>Will Evans</a> and  <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/" rel='nofollow'>Anne Condon</a>, 
				 	 who both abated my confusion on many occasions. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on computing in dynamic 
				 	 environments under uncertainty. 
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 	During my undergraduate I founded <a href="http://codethechange.ca/" ref='nofollow'>Code the Change UBC</a>, which is now its own foundation (and is much better run).
