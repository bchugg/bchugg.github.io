			<h4>
				Hello! I have big ears and I'm addicted to podcasts. I'm also a fan of the Oxford comma. 
			</h4>

			<h4>
				I'm currently an M.Sc. student at the <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a> at <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford</a>. This is where one would typically list their current research interests. I'm still looking for mine.  
			</h4>

			<h4>
				Previously, I spent some time at <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/">RIKEN AIP</a> in Tokyo, where I was  lucky to work with <a href="http://www.prefield.com/index.html">Dr. Maehara</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/discr_optimize/">Discrete Optimization Unit</a>. Here I spent most of my time confused about submodular stochastic optimization problems. Prior to that, I spent several wonderful years at the  
			 	<a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a> studying mathematics and computer science. While there, my time spent on research was split between being confused about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction_network_theory">Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>. I was immensely fortunate to be supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~will/">Will Evans</a> and  <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/">Anne Condon</a>, who both abated my confusion on many occasions. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on computing in dynamic environments under uncertainty.

			<!-- <h4>More broadly, I'm interested in cross-disciplinary applications of computer science to health care, genomics and the non-profit sector. I'm the founder of <a href="https://codethechangeubc.org">Code the Change UBC</a>, an organization of students providing free software for non-profits who cannot afford it otherwise. We are a derivative of <a href="https://codethechange.org">Code the Change</a> at Stanford. I'm also the co-founder of the <a href="http://graceorphancare.org/">Friends of Grace Orphan Care Society</a>, a non-profit helping a small, locally run Malawian Orphan Care achieve financial sustainability. </h4> -->
