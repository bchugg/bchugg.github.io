abstract: 'We classify the functions \(f:\mathbb{N}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)
        that are stably computable by leaderless, output-oblivious discrete (stochastic)
        Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). CRNs that compute such functions
        are systems of reactions over species that include \(d\) designated
        input species, whose initial counts represent an input \(x \in
        \mathbb{N}^d\), and one output species whose eventual count represents
        \(f(x)\). Chen et al. showed that the class of functions computable by CRNs is
        precisely the semilinear functions.
        In output-oblivious CRNs, the output species is never a reactant. Output-oblivious CRNs are easily composable since a downstream CRN can consume the output of an upstream CRN without affecting its correctness. Severson et al. showed that output-oblivious CRNs compute exactly the subclass of semilinear functions that are eventually the minimum of
        quilt-affine functions, i.e., affine functions with different intercepts in each of finitely many congruence classes. They call such functions the output-oblivious functions. A leaderless CRN can compute only superadditive functions, and so a leaderless output-oblivious CRN can compute only superadditive, output-oblivious functions. In this work we show that a function
        \(f:\mathbb{N}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) is stably computable by a leaderless, output-oblivious CRN if and only if it is superadditive and
        output-oblivious.'
