abstract: 'We classify the functions \(f: \mathbb{N}^2 \to \mathbb{N}\)
        which are stably computable by output-oblivious Stochastic
        Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs), i.e., systems of reactions in which output species are never
        reactants. While it is known that precisely the semilinear functions are stably computable by
        CRNs, such CRNs sometimes rely on initially producing too many output species, and then
        consuming the excess in order to reach a correct stable state. These CRNs may be difficult to
        integrate into larger systems: if the output of a CRN \(C_1\) becomes the input to a downstream CRN \(C_2\), then \(C_2\)
        could inadvertently consume too many outputs before \(C_1\) stabilizes. If, on the other
        hand, \(C_1\) is output-oblivious then \(C_2\)
        may consume output from \(C_2\) as soon as it is available. In this work we prove that a semilinear function \(f : \mathbb{N}^2\to\mathbb{N}\)
        is stably computable by an output-oblivious CRN
        with a leader if and only if it is both increasing and either grid-affine (intuitively, its domains
        are congruence classes), or the minimum of a finite set of fissure functions (intuitively, functions
        behaving like the min function).'
