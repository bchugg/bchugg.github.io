abstract: 'We introduce Stochastic Probing with Prices (SPP), a variant of the Stochastic
        Probing (SP) model in which we must pay a price to probe an element. A SPP problem involves two set systems \((\mathcal{N} , \mathcal{I}_{in})\) and \((\mathcal{N} , \mathcal{I}_{out})\) where each \(e\in\mathcal{N}\) is active with
        probability \(p_e\). To discover whether an element \(e\) is active, it must be probed by paying
        the price \(\Delta_e\). If an element is probed and is active, then it is irrevocably added to the
        solution. Moreover, at all times, the set of probed elements must lie in \(\mathcal{I}_{out}\), and the
        solution (the set of probed and active elements) must lie in \(\mathcal{I}_{in}\). The goal is to maximize a submodular set function \(f\) minus the cost of the probes. We give a bi-criteria
        approximation algorithm to the online version of this problem, in which the elements
        are shown to the algorithm in a possibly adversarial order. Our results translate to
        state-of-the-art approximations for the traditional (online) stochastic probing problem.'
