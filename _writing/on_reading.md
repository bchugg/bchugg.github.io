- Cursory reading: Reading places bookmarks in your mind. The goal is not to remember everything you read, not even to understand everything. The goal understand the topic and opinion of the author enough so that you can return to it later. E.g., Steven Pinker's Enlightenment now. Who's going to remember all those details? Could also be less metaphorical if you take brief notes, highlight book, etc.  A good new book is one that has placed many bookmarks in my mind, a bad one has placed few to none. 

- Problem focused reading: Cashing in the bookmarks. This is for when you have a problem that you're trying to solve. 

Reading something only once and attempting to understand all of it is asking way too much of yourself. Learning comes from repetiton, and from engaging critically with idea in an arena of competing ideas. Learning is problem-driven.
