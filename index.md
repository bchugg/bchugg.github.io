I'm a PhD student in [machine learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and [statistics](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) at CMU. I'm advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) and a member of the [StatML group](http://statml.cs.cmu.edu/).

Before CMU I was doing various things at Oxford, Stanford, and UBC. Here is an entirely-unnecessary-yet-for-some-reason-expected [CV](assets/files/cv.pdf). You can reach me at benchugg $$\alpha\tau$$ cmu.edu.

## Research 

These days I mostly think about problems in mathematical statistics and probability theory. Two areas of particular interest are concentration of measure and game-theoretic statistics (anytime-valid inference, e-values, hypothesis testing, and martingales). 


Here are [my papers]({% link papers.md %}) and some [informal research notes]({% link research_notes.md %}). 
<!-- I also maintain a [second brain for statistics](https://thestatsmap.com/).  -->


## Other

I write at [Steps to Phaeacia](https://www.stepstophaeacia.com/). Sometimes I also talk, and sometimes I talk in public about applied philosophy and other topics on the [Increments podcast](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/).  I also co-host [do you even lit?](https://doyouevenlit.podbean.com/) where two unintelligible kiwis and I make our (haphazard and tangent-filled) way through the world of literary classics.
