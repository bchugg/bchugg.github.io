I'm an incoming PhD student in the [machine learning department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University.  Currently, I'm the lead research analyst at Stanford Law School's 
Regulation, Evaluation, and Governance Lab (<a href="https://reglab.stanford.edu/" rel='nofollow'>RegLab</a>). 


On the side, I co-host the <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/" ref='nofollow'>Increments</a> podcast, where <a href="https://vmasrani.github.io/">Vaden Masrani</a> and I yell at each other and others about philosophy and science. Sometimes I also [write]({% link writing.md %}) about these topics. I often distract myself with good [books]({% link books.md %}) and interesting online [courses]({% link courses.md %}). 


You can contact me at benchugg $$\alpha\tau$$ stanford.edu.

# research interests
My primary interests at the moment involve developing robust sequential decision-making algorithms, particularly through a non-parametric and non-asymptotic lens, that are as assumption free as possible. I've previously worked on problems in graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic reaction networks.

Ideally, I try and straddle the borderlands between theory and practice with a bias towards the former, but apparently the results have high variance because I've spent time doing doing both pure theory and pure application. 

My papers are [here]({% link papers.md %}). I've recently begun keeping some [research notes]({% link research_notes.md %}) as well.

# erratic bio

Prior to Stanford, I was a master's student at the <a rel='nofollow' href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a>
at Oxford, where I studied topics at the intersection of spectral graph theory and geometry. <a href="files/ox_thesis.pdf">Here</a> is my thesis on the subject.
			
In 2018, I spent some time at <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/" rel='nofollow'>RIKEN AIP</a>
in Tokyo, where I was  lucky to work with <a href="http://www.prefield.com/index.html" rel='nofollow'>Takanori Maehara</a>
as part of the Discrete Optimization Unit.

My undergraduate was spent at the University of British Columbia studying mathematics and computer science, where I was immensely fortunate to be
supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~will/" rel='nofollow'>Will Evans</a> and  <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/" rel='nofollow'>Anne Condon</a>.

# increments
The podcast is mostly an attempt to break out of the academic echochamber and talk about things other than limit theorems and algorithmic performance. We have a few beers and chat about anything from <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/26" rel='nofollow'>moral philosophy</a>  and <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/22" rel='nofollow'>thought experiments</a>, to the <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/28" rel='nofollow'>philosophy of logic</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/32" rel='nofollow'>climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/23" rel='nofollow'>free will</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/24" rel='nofollow'>dualism</a>, and <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/15" rel='nofollow'>social media</a>.  
We also have an ongoing series on <em>Conjectures and Refutations</em> by Karl Popper.
