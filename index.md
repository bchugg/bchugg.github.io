I'm a first year PhD student in the [machine learning department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at CMU, where I'm advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). 

On the side, I co-host the <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/" ref='nofollow'>Increments</a> podcast, where <a href="https://vmasrani.github.io/">Vaden Masrani</a> and I yell at each other and others about philosophy and science. Occasionally I also [write]({% link writing.md %}) things. 

Previously, I was the lead research analyst at Stanford's [RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/). Prior to Stanford I was a master's student at Oxford's [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), and before that I was an undergraduate in maths and computer science at UBC. Sometime before that I played Lego and watched a lot of Blue's Clues. 


You can contact me at benchugg $$\alpha\tau$$ cmu.edu. In accordance with the bizarre norms of academia, here is my [CV](assets/files/cv.pdf).

# research interests

You can find my papers [here]({% link papers.md %}) and some informal research notes [here]({% link research_notes.md %}). 

My primary interests at the moment involve developing robust algorithms for sequential problems, particularly in nonparametric  settings. I'm increasingly interested in game-theoretic statistics, and algorithmic statistics more generally, for this purpose. Previously, I worked on problems in graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic reaction networks.

Ideally, I try and straddle the borderlands between theory and practice with a bias towards the former, but apparently the results have high variance because I've spent time doing doing both pure theory and pure application.

# increments
The podcast is mostly an attempt to break out of the academic echo chamber and talk about things other than limit theorems and algorithmic performance. We have a few beers and chat about anything from <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/26" rel='nofollow'>moral philosophy</a>  and <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/22" rel='nofollow'>thought experiments</a>, to the <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/28" rel='nofollow'>philosophy of logic</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/32" rel='nofollow'>climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/23" rel='nofollow'>free will</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/24" rel='nofollow'>dualism</a>, and <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/15" rel='nofollow'>social media</a>.  
We also have an ongoing series on <em>Conjectures and Refutations</em> by Karl Popper.
