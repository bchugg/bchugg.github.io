I'm a PhD student in the joint program between [machine learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and [statistics](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) at CMU. I'm lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). 
Here is an entirely-unnecessary-yet-for-some-reason-expected [CV](assets/files/cv.pdf). I'm a member of the [StatML group](http://statml.cs.cmu.edu/).

## Research 

These days I mostly think about problems in mathematical statistics and probability theory. Two areas of particular interest are concentration of measure and game-theoretic statistics (anytime-valid inference, e-values, hypothesis testing, and martingales). 


Here are [my papers]({% link papers.md %}) and some [informal research notes]({% link research_notes.md %}).


## Other

Occasionally I [write]({% link writing.md %}). You can [subscribe]({% link subscribe.md %}) to be notified of new essays. 

After-hours, I co-host the [Increments podcast](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/). We have a few [_sic_] drinks and yell about topics ranging from the [problem of induction](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/75) to the [evolutionary origins of art](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/50). I also co-host [do you even lit?](https://doyouevenlit.podbean.com/) where two unintelligible kiwis and I make our (haphazard and tangent-filled) way through the world of literary classics.
