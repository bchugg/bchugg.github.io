I'm an incoming PhD student in the [machine learning department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University.  Currently, I'm the lead research analyst at Stanford Law School's 
Regulation, Evaluation, and Governance Lab (<a href="https://reglab.stanford.edu/" rel='nofollow'>RegLab</a>). Before Stanford I was a master's student at Oxford's [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), and before that I was an undergraduate at UBC. 


On the side, I co-host the <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/" ref='nofollow'>Increments</a> podcast, where <a href="https://vmasrani.github.io/">Vaden Masrani</a> and I yell at each other and others about philosophy and science. Sometimes I also [write]({% link writing.md %}) about these topics. 


You can contact me at benchugg $$\alpha\tau$$ stanford.edu.

# research interests
My primary interests at the moment involve developing robust algorithms for sequential decision problems, particularly in non-parametric and non-asymptotic settings. I'm increasingly interested in game-theoretic statistics, and algorithmic statistics more generally, for this purpose. Previously, I worked on problems in graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and stochastic reaction networks.

Ideally, I try and straddle the borderlands between theory and practice with a bias towards the former, but apparently the results have high variance because I've spent time doing doing both pure theory and pure application. 

My papers are [here]({% link papers.md %}). I've recently begun keeping some [research notes]({% link research_notes.md %}) as well.

# increments
The podcast is mostly an attempt to break out of the academic echo chamber and talk about things other than limit theorems and algorithmic performance. We have a few beers and chat about anything from <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/26" rel='nofollow'>moral philosophy</a>  and <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/22" rel='nofollow'>thought experiments</a>, to the <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/28" rel='nofollow'>philosophy of logic</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/32" rel='nofollow'>climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/23" rel='nofollow'>free will</a>, <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/24" rel='nofollow'>dualism</a>, and <a href="https://www.incrementspodcast.com/15" rel='nofollow'>social media</a>.  
We also have an ongoing series on <em>Conjectures and Refutations</em> by Karl Popper.
