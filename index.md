<p id='index-intro-text' markdown="1">
I'm a second year PhD student in the joint program between [machine learning](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and [statistics](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) at CMU. I'm lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). 
Here is an entirely-unnecessary-yet-for-some-reason-expected [CV](assets/files/cv.pdf). I'm a member of the [StatML group](http://statml.cs.cmu.edu/).

You can reach me at benchugg $$\alpha\tau$$ cmu.edu.

## Research 

<p id='index-main-text' markdown="1">
I'm mainly interested in mathematical statistics and applied probability---sequential analysis, game-theoretic probability, and anytime-valid learning and inference in particular. Here are 
my [papers]({% link papers.md %}) and some informal [research notes]({% link research_notes.md %}). 
</p>

## Other

Occasionally I [write]({% link writing.md %}). If you enjoy eclectic permutations of philosophy, sporadic book reviews, some statistics, and lukewarm takes you can [subscribe]({% link subscribe.md %}) to be notified of new essays. 

After-hours, I co-host the [Increments podcast](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/). We have a few [_sic_] drinks and yell about topics ranging from [the reality of abstractions](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/24) to the [evolutionary origins of art](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/50). I also co-host [do you even lit?](https://doyouevenlit.podbean.com/) where two unintelligible kiwis and I make our (haphazard and tangent-filled) way through the world of literary classics.

## contact

You can try and reach me by email (benchugg $$\alpha\tau$$ cmu.edu) or by screaming my name twelve times in succession in a very public place. The latter has, to my knowledge, never not worked.
