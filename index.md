I'm a second year PhD student in the [machine learning department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at CMU. I'm advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/).  Here is a totally-unnecessary-yet-for-some-reason-expected [CV](assets/files/cv.pdf).

Research-wise, I'm mainly interested in mathematical statistics---sequential analysis, game-theoretic probability, and anytime-valid learning and inference in particular. Here are 
my [papers]({% link papers.md %}) and some informal [research notes]({% link research_notes.md %}). 

Occasionally I [write]({% link writing.md %}), mostly as a selfish means to improve my own understanding. Should you enjoy eclectic permutations of philosophy, sporadic book reviews, some statistics, and lukewarm takes you can [subscribe]({% link subscribe.md %}) to be notified of new essays. 

I also co-host the [Increments Podcast](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/) with [Vaden Masrani](https://vmasrani.github.io/). We have a few [_sic_] drinks and yell about topics ranging from the [philosophy of logic](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/28) and [the reality of abstractions](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/24) to  [education](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/37) and the [evolutionary origins of art](https://www.incrementspodcast.com/50).

## contact

You can try and reach me by email (benchugg $$\alpha\tau$$ cmu.edu), twitter, or by screaming my name twelve times in succession in a very public place. The latter has, to my knowledge, never not worked.
