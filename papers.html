							In many public health settings, there is a perceived tension between
							allocating resources to known vulnerable areas and learning about the overall
							prevalence of the problem. Inspired by a door-to-door Covid-19 testing program
							we helped design, we combine multi-armed bandit strategies and insights from
							sampling theory to demonstrate how to recover accurate prevalence estimates
							while continuing to allocate resources to at-risk areas. We use the outbreak of
							an infectious disease as our running example. The public health setting has
							several characteristics distinguishing it from typical bandit settings, such as
							distribution shift (the true disease prevalence is changing with time) and
							batched sampling (multiple decisions must be made simultaneously).
							Nevertheless, we demonstrate that several bandit algorithms are capable
							out-performing greedy resource allocation strategies, which often perform worse
							than random allocation as they fail to notice outbreaks in new areas.

							Environmental enforcement has historically relied on physical, resource-intensive, and infrequent inspections. Advances in remote sensing and computer vision have the potential to augment compliance monitoring, by providing early warning signals of permit violations. We demonstrate a process for rapid identification of significant structural expansion using satellite imagery and focusing on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) as a test case. Unpermitted expansion has been a particular challenge with CAFOs, which pose significant health and environmental risks. Using a new hand-labeled dataset of 175,736 images of 1,513 CAFOs, we combine state-of-the-art building segmentation with a likelihood-based change-point detection model to provide a robust signal of building expansion (AUC = 0.80). A major advantage of this approach is that it is able to work with high-cadence (daily to weekly), but lower resolution (3m/pixel), satellite imagery. It is also highly generalizable and thus provides a near real-time monitoring tool to prioritize enforcement resources to other settings where unpermitted construction poses environmental risk, e.g. zoning, habitat modification, or wetland protection.

						<b>Composable Computation in Leaderless, Discrete Chemical Reaction Networks.</b> <em>International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming.</em> 2020.

							We classify the functions \(f:\mathbb{N}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)
							that are stably computable by leaderless, output-oblivious discrete (stochastic)
							Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). CRNs that compute such functions
							are systems of reactions over species that include \(d\) designated
							input species, whose initial counts represent an input \(x \in
							\mathbb{N}^d\), and one output species whose eventual count represents
							\(f(x)\). Chen et al. showed that the class of functions computable by CRNs is
							precisely the semilinear functions.
							In output-oblivious CRNs, the output species is never a reactant. Output-oblivious CRNs are easily composable since a downstream CRN can consume the output of an upstream CRN without affecting its correctness. Severson et al. showed that output-oblivious CRNs compute exactly the subclass of semilinear functions that are eventually the minimum of
							quilt-affine functions, i.e., affine functions with different intercepts in each of finitely many congruence classes. They call such functions the output-oblivious functions. A leaderless CRN can compute only superadditive functions, and so a leaderless output-oblivious CRN can compute only superadditive, output-oblivious functions. In this work we show that a function
							\(f:\mathbb{N}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) is stably computable by a leaderless, output-oblivious CRN if and only if it is superadditive and
							output-oblivious.

						<div id="abs3" class="collapse abs">
							We consider the problem of determining if a pair of undirected graphs \(\langle G_V,G_H\rangle\), which share the same vertex set, has a representation using opaque geometric shapes for vertices, and vertical/horizontal visibility between shapes to determine the edges of \(G_V/G_H\). While such a simultaneous visibility representation of two graphs can be determined efficiently if the direction of the required visibility for each edge is provided (and the vertex shapes are sufficiently simple), it was unclear if edge direction is critical for efficiency. We show that the problem is NP-complete without that information, even for graphs that are only slightly more complex than paths. In addition, we characterize which pairs of paths have simultaneous visibility representations using fixed orientation L-shapes. This narrows the range of possible graph families for which determining simultaneous visibility representation is non-trivial yet not NP-hard.

						<div id="abs2" class="collapse abs">
							We introduce Stochastic Probing with Prices (SPP), a variant of the Stochastic
							Probing (SP) model in which we must pay a price to probe an element. A SPP problem involves two set systems \((\mathcal{N} , \mathcal{I}_{in})\) and \((\mathcal{N} , \mathcal{I}_{out})\) where each \(e\in\mathcal{N}\) is active with
							probability \(p_e\). To discover whether an element \(e\) is active, it must be probed by paying
							the price \(\Delta_e\). If an element is probed and is active, then it is irrevocably added to the
							solution. Moreover, at all times, the set of probed elements must lie in \(\mathcal{I}_{out}\), and the
							solution (the set of probed and active elements) must lie in \(\mathcal{I}_{in}\). The goal is to maximize a submodular set function \(f\) minus the cost of the probes. We give a bi-criteria
							approximation algorithm to the online version of this problem, in which the elements
							are shown to the algorithm in a possibly adversarial order. Our results translate to
							state-of-the-art approximations for the traditional (online) stochastic probing problem.

							We classify the functions \(f: \mathbb{N}^2\to \mathbb{N}\)
							which are stably computable by output-oblivious Stochastic
							Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs), i.e., systems of reactions in which output species are never
							reactants. While it is known that precisely the semilinear functions are stably computable by
							CRNs, such CRNs sometimes rely on initially producing too many output species, and then
							consuming the excess in order to reach a correct stable state. These CRNs may be difficult to
							integrate into larger systems: if the output of a CRN \(C\) becomes the input to a downstream CRN \(C'\), then \(C'\)
							could inadvertently consume too many outputs before \(C\) stabilizes. If, on the other
							hand, \(C\) is output-oblivious then \(C'\)
							may consume \(C\)'s output as soon as it is available. In this work
							we prove that a semilinear function \(f : \mathbb{N}^2\to\mathbb{N}\)
							is stably computable by an output-oblivious CRN
							with a leader if and only if it is both increasing and either grid-affine (intuitively, its domains
							are congruence classes), or the minimum of a finite set of fissure functions (intuitively, functions

						The Graph-Simplex Correspondence and its Algorithmic Foundations. [<a href="files/ox_thesis.pdf">pdf</a>]<br>
						M.Sc. Thesis. <br>
						<button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#abs0">+ Abstract</button>
						<div id="abs0" class="collapse abs">
							We present and study the graph-simplex correspondence&mdash;a tool providing a series of relationships between weighted, undirected graphs on \(n\) vertices and simplices in \((n-1)\)-dimensional
							Euclidean space. The core of the correspondence is a bijection between graphs and hyperacute simplices, first uncovered by Miroslav Fiedler. We consolidate Fiedler's work on the
							subject and expand on it in several ways. <br>
							The first relates purely to the mathematical properties of the correspondence. Among
							other things, we extend the correspondence to the normalized Laplacian matrix \(\widehat{L}_G\) (whereas
							previously only the combinatorial Laplacian, \(L_G\), had been used), develop new equations
							and inequalities relating aspects of the simplex to those of the graph, and give an isometry
							between a graph's "inverse combinatorial simplex" and an \(n\)-dimensional polytope arising
							from the Laplacian's pseudoinverse. <br>
							Secondly, we examine the algorithmic underpinnings and consequences of the correspondence. We begin by demonstrating that it can be used to draw conclusions about the computational complexity of various geometric problems. We then provide lower bounds on
							the complexity of transitioning between graphs and simplices, and end by studying low dimensional representations of the simplices. This provides theoretical justification for recent
							empirical work on Laplacian eigenmaps. <br>
							Of possible independent interest, we provide a formula for the non-zero eigenvalues of
							\(\widehat{L}_G\) in terms of the total weight of spanning trees in the graph \(G\), relate the volume of an
							arbitrary simplex to the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix of its dual simplex (an object we
							introduce), and give an equation for the adjugate of \(\widehat{L}_G\) in terms of the weights of the vertices
							in \(G\).
