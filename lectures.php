						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spBaumdWlgQ&list=PLzWd5Ny3vW3TiC-suoKg71WBuJkxxxrgY">Ideas of the Twentieth Century</a>, by Daniel Bonevac. <br>
						Thanks to <a href="https://vmasrani.github.io/">Vaden Masrani</a> for this suggestion. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Michael Sandel's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30C13C91CFFEFEA6">course on Justice</a> is mesmorizing.

						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D">Introduction to Human Behavioural Biology</a>, by Robert Sapolsky. 
						His lectures on 
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc">depression</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwAQqWUkpI">the biological 
						underpinnings of religiosity</a> deserve to be mentioned in tandem to this course. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FB14A2200B87185">Financial Markets</a> with Robert Shiller. 
						I swear it's more interesting than it sounds. Also, if you were to describe his lecture style as "adorable" 
						you wouldn't be wrong.
