						<em>80,000 hours podcast</em>, hosted by Rob Wiblin. 
						<br>
						"A show about the world's most pressing problems and how you can use your career to solve them", all in a sexy Australian accent. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>The Ezra Klein Show</em>, hosted by Ezra Klein. 
						<br>

					<li>
						<em>EconTalk</em>, hosted by Russ Roberts. 
						<br>

						<em>Planet Money</em>, hosted by a whole host of people, including Robert Smith, Stacey Vanek Smith (they're not married), Bryan Urstadt, Jacob Goldstein, and Ailsa Chang.
					</li>

					</li>
					<li>
						<em>More Perfect</em>, hosted by Jad Abumrad. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Mindscape</em>, hosted by Sean Carroll. 
					</li>

						<br> 
						"I'm here with &lsaquo;firstname&rsaquo; &lsaquo;lastname&rsaquo;. &lsaquo;Firstname&rsaquo;, thanks for coming on the podcast."
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>You are not so smart</em>, hosted by David McRaney. 
						<br>
						I always knew, but now it's enforced on a biweekly (fornightly for you Brits) basis.
