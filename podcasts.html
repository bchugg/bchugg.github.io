				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>80,000 hours podcast</em>, hosted by Rob Wiblin. 
						<br>
						"A show about the world's most pressing problems and how you can use your career to solve them", all in a sexy Australian accent. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Conversations with Tyler</em>, hosted by Tyler Cowen. <br> 
						One of the most unique thinkers I've ever come across.  

					</li>
					<li>
						<em>The Ezra Klein Show</em>, hosted by Ezra Klein. 
						<br>
						Whatever your politics, Ezra Klein is a ruthlessly insightful and talented interviewer. He also does a hell of a job advertising razors. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>The Glenn Show</em>, hosted by Glenn Loury. 
						<br> 
						I'm confident his speaking vocabulary is a strict superset of my reading vocabulary. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Hardcore History</em>, hosted by Dan Carlin. 
						<br> 
						I could listen to Dan Carlin talk about anything for the rest of my life. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>EconTalk</em>, hosted by Russ Roberts. 
						<br> 
						Forms an unhealthy percentage of my knowledge of economics.  
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>History on Fire</em>, hosted by Daniele Bolelli. 
						<br> 
						I never know if I'm more excited by the history itself or Daniele's amazing Italian accent.  
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Ideas by CBC Radio</em>, hosted by Paul Kennedy. 
						<br> 
						Plug for Canada. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Philosophize This!</em>, hosted by Stephen West. 
						<br> 
						Sometimes I daydream about meeting Stephen West at a party and having him explain the Frankfurt school to me. 
					</li>
					<!-- <li>
						<em>Planet Money</em>, hosted by a whole host of people, including Robert Smith, Stacey Vanek Smith (they're not married), Bryan Urstadt, Jacob Goldstein, and Ailsa Chang.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Radiolab</em>, hosted by Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich (and sometimes Molly Webster?)
					</li> -->
					<li>
						<em>More Perfect</em>, hosted by Jad Abumrad. 
						<br>
						I now know much more about the American Supreme Court than that of my native country.  
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Mindscape</em>, hosted by Sean Carroll. <br> 
						So ... let's go!
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>The Ted Interview</em>, hosted by Chris Anderson. 
						<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Very Bad Wizards</em>, hosted by David Pizarro and Tamler Somers. 
						<br> 
						I don't often laugh aloud to podcasts, but when I do it's thanks to VBW. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Waking Up</em>, hosted by Sam Harris.
						<br> 
						"I'm here with &lsaquo;firstname&rsaquo; &lsaquo;lastname&rsaquo;. &lsaquo;Firstname&rsaquo;, thanks for coming on the podcast."
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>You are not so smart</em>, hosted by David McRaney. 
						<br>
						I always knew, but now it's enforced on a biweekly basis. 
					</li>
