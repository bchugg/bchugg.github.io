You can subscribe by email to receive occasional[^1] updates about new essays. I'll send you things I've written and possibly a few other findings worth ingesting. 

[^1]: Probably something like bi-monthly with a standard deviation of a few months ...  

No spam and you can unsubscribe at any time. It will cause only minor amounts of existential horror on my end.
