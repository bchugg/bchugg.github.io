<p>A common criticism of standard, frequentist Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing is that it’s extremely brittle under data-dependent choices of the parameters. In particular, the significance level \(\alpha\) must be chosen in advance of seeing the data (<a href="/research_notes/p_values/">we previously studied this in the specific case of p-values</a>). As soon as \(\alpha\) is data-dependent whatsoever, all the guarantees provided by Neyman-Pearson theory begin to break.</p>

<p>One response to this problem is to yell at practitioners until they get it in their heads that they can’t make these illegal post-hoc decisions. We’ve been doing this for many years, with limited success. There’s just too much incentive to p-hack.</p>

<p>Another response is to try and save Neyman-Pearson theory by making it post-hoc valid. This was the goal of <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00901">Peter Grünwald’s 2024 PNAS paper</a>. I’m very sympathetic to this approach, and also wrote <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00770">a paper</a> about it. But there are drawbacks, the biggest being that the kind of guarantee you obtain is different than the standard error probabilities. It’s a heavy lift to convince the entire world to stop reporting p-values. Every social scientist would lose their mind.</p>

<p>A third response is to give up on Neyman-Pearson theory and become a Bayesian. Enough of these type-I error guarantees and asymmetries between the null and the alternative. We’ll just put a prior over everything and update our posteriors, which tells us all we need to know.</p>

<p>This is controversial. I think it’s fair to say that Bayesian methods are in the minority when it comes to applied statistics. Most analysts rely on frequentist tools like p-values, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals.</p>

<p>But Bayesianism does have a nice property: unlike Neyman-Pearson theory, it’s post-hoc valid! That is, the loss function (their rough equivalent of the significance level) can change as a function of the data. This means that you can gather data, analyze it, change your goals and even what question you’re asking, and then re-analyze. Regardless of how you feel about Bayesian statistics, you have to admit that this is extremely compelling.</p>

<p>But as far as I can tell, that Bayesian theory is post-hoc valid is always stated as folklore. I’ve never seen a formal statement or proof anywhere. So that’s what we’re doing here.</p>

<p>Let \(\Theta\) be a parameter space, \(\calA\) a set of actions, and \(L:\Theta\times \calA\to\Re_{\geq 0}\) a loss function. Associated to each \(\theta\in\Theta\) is a distribution \(P_\theta\). 
Let \(\pi\) be a prior on \(\Theta\). Given observations \(X\), Bayesian decision theory tells us to minimize the expected posterior loss. That is, we take action 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bayes_estimator}
    \delta_\pi(X) \equiv \argmin_{a\in\calA} \E_{\theta \sim \pi(\cdot|X)} L(\theta, a). \tag{1}
\end{equation}
A fundamental result is that the <em>Bayes optimal decision rule</em>, henceforth “Bayes decision” for brevity, is always given by \(\delta_\pi\), meaning that it satisfies \(B_\pi(\delta_\pi) = \inf_\delta B_\pi(\delta)\) where 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bayes_risk}
    B_\pi(\delta) = \E_{\theta\sim \pi} \E_{X\sim P_\theta}[L(\theta, \delta(X))].  \tag{2}
\end{equation}
(Note that \(\theta\) is drawn from the prior \(\pi\) in \eqref{eq:bayes_risk}, not the posterior \(\pi(\cdot|X)\) as in \eqref{eq:bayes_estimator}.) Bayes estimators are, as the name suggests, the Bayesian equivalent to frequentist minimax estimators, and a unified solution for the Bayes decision regardless of the loss function is a big benefit of Bayesian decision theory.</p>

<p>To move to a post-hoc setting, let’s consider a set of losses \(\{L_b\}_{b\in\calB}\). 
Suppose an adversary is allowed to choose which loss we’re using, and this choice can be data-dependent. That is, the adversary sees the data, then chooses the loss. 
We can encode the adversary as a measurable map \(B:\calX\to\calB\) (where the data \(X\) is taking values in \(\calX\)).</p>

<p>With this setup, Bayesian theory can accommodate a post-hoc selection of the loss in the following sense: If we minimize the expected posterior loss as before but on loss \(L_{B(X)}\) (which we observe), then the resulting decision rule minimizes Bayes risk, where the Bayes risk is now defined in terms of the loss selected by the adversary. More formally:</p>

<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> The decision rule 
\begin{equation}
\phi_\pi(X) = \argmin_{a\in\calA} \E_{\theta\sim \pi(\cdot|X)} L_{B(X)} (\theta, a),
\end{equation}
satisfies 
\begin{equation}
    \E_{\theta\sim\pi} \E_{X\sim P_\theta} L_{B(X)}(\theta, \phi_\pi(X)) = \inf_{\phi} \E_{\theta\sim\pi} \E_{X\sim P_\theta} L_{B(X)}(\theta, \phi(X)), 
\end{equation}
for all \(B:\calX\to\calB\).</p>

<p>Note that \(\phi_\pi\) is well-defined since \(\phi\) is allowed to see \(B(X)\) (if \(\phi\) is not allowed to see \(B(X)\) before making a decision, then the problem is basically impossible to solve. You’d have to assume a worse case loss).</p>

<p>Again, this result isn’t new per se, and the proof isn’t difficult. But I can’t find a similar statement anywhere.</p>

<p>The proof is pretty straightforward. For any decision rule \(\phi\), let \(\ell(\phi(x) \vert x) = \E_{\theta\sim \pi(\cdot\vert x)} L_{B(x)}(\theta, \phi(x))\) be its expected posterior loss at a given \(x\) on loss \(L_{B(x)}\).  For simplicity, assume that \(P_\theta\) has density \(p(\cdot\vert\theta)\). Let \(p(x) = \int p(x\vert\theta)\pi(\theta)\d\theta\) be the marginal and note that \(p(x\vert \theta)\pi(\theta) = \pi(\theta\vert x)p(x)\). Then, by Fubini’s theorem,</p>

\[\begin{align}
    \E_{\theta\sim\pi} \E_{X\sim P_\theta} L_{B(X)}(\theta, \phi(X)) &amp;= \int_\Theta \int_\calX L_{B(x)} (\theta, \phi(x)) p(x|\theta)\pi(\theta)\d x\d\theta \\ 
    &amp;= \int_\calX \int_\Theta L_{B(x)} (\theta, \phi(x)) \pi(\theta|x)p(x)\d \theta\d x \\ 
    &amp;= \int_\calX \ell(\phi(x)|x) p(x) \d\theta.
\end{align}\]

<p>By minimizing the expected posterior \(\ell(\phi(x)\vert x)\) we’re minimizing the above integrand at every \(x\), thus minimizing the value of the integral.</p>

<p>And there we have it. In the recent <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00770">paper</a> that I mentioned, we also discuss what a notion of type-I error might  look like for Bayesians, and provide a decision rule which satisfies it. If you made it this far, you might like that.</p>
