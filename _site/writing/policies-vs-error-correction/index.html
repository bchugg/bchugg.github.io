  <p class='title'>Trumping the means of error correction</p> 
  <p id="date">August 01, 2024</p>
  <br/><br/>
  <p>If I had to label myself, I would hesitatingly choose “critical rationalist.” I have a growing aversion to associating my views with any group or slogan, having experienced how such branding can disable my ability to think clearly. But I admire the philosophy of critical rationalism more so than any other, and it would be cheap to refuse to recognize its impact on my thinking.</p>

<p>In fact, calling critical rationalism a philosophy nearly misses the mark. There’s no required metaphysical, moral, or political view you must adopt to be invited to this club. You must instead opt into a tradition—a tradition of criticism. This tradition is motivated by the recognition that humans are imperfect; that we are fallible. Our thinking is error-prone, our knowledge tentative, our ability to see into the future limited.</p>

<p><img id="img-50" src="/assets/writing_images/popper_npg.jpeg" /></p>
<p id="center" class="caption">Karl Popper invented the phrase critical rationalism to set his philosophy apart from traditional rationalism and empiricism.

<p>Acknowledging our fallibility may seem a small thing but the consequences run deep. It implies that mistakes are par for the course; that error—personal, scientific, and political—is inevitable. What matters is not certainty nor always being correct, but rather how we identify and correct error across the personal, ethical, scientific, political realms.</p>

<p>And this is done with criticism—by being willing to criticize our ideas, and to have others criticize them. This is the tradition of criticism: the recognition that progress entails creating institutions that have as one their primary aims the ability to detect and correct errors by means of critical feedback. It’s this tradition that’s allowed us to make slow, incremental progress towards building a better world. Destroying this tradition destroys our means of error correction, which is perhaps the only moral foundation agreed upon by all critical rationalists.</p>

<p>In science, the tradition of criticism takes the form of peer-review and falsification.<br />
A scientist’s word counts for nothing; no one is given the authority to issue truth by decree.  Instead, we have him write down his arguments and present them to others for evaluation.</p>

<p>In politics, the tradition of criticism has several components. One is free speech, the ability to point out what you perceive as errors being made by the culture and those in power. Another is, of course, our democratic norms. Democracy at its best is the means by which we tentatively try policies, but voters retain the power to dismiss those they don’t like and the leaders that proposed them. Democracy is not about justice or fairness or equality—admirable as such goals may be—it’s simply our current best idea about how to instantiate a system of social experimentation and error correction on the political stage. Instead of subjecting ourselves to the whims of a monarch, we bestow temporary and partial power to elected officials. And if we don’t like the results, we vote them out of office.</p>

<p>I am partial to critical rationalism because I believe in and am proud of the tradition of criticism that the West has, by and large, adopted. It is therefore with some alarm that I see self-proclaimed critical rationalists ride the wave of support for Donald Trump, a man whose every utterance displays his contempt for the tradition of criticism that we’ve fought for so long to establish and maintain.</p>

<p>Support for Trump is usually justified by appealing to specific policies. Perhaps he has promised to be better on nuclear energy or open-source software or foreign policy than his opponents. This could all be true, but is irrelevant. Specific policies take a backseat to our ability to maintain the integrity of our institutions. Allowing your vote to be swayed by a pet policy preference at the risk of denegrading the tradition of criticism indicates you’re fundamentally unserious about preserving the means of error correction.</p>

<p>Democracy is upheld by both formal (legal) and informal (cultural) means, and Trump has eroded both. He has shattered the norms against lying to such an extent that even the most left-leaning outlets barely notice anymore. He has normalized calling for your political opponents to be jailed, bullied, or worse, and has convinced roughly half the country that the previous election was illegitimate. He encouraged supporters to storm the capitol building and refused a peaceful transfer of power. The list goes on.</p>

<p>One does not have to believe that a second Trump term will result in anything as dramatic as a coup or a dictatorship to acknowledge the danger. One simply has to be worried that he will continue to damage our institutions, the same sort of damage we’ve witnessed over the past eight years. We need only be worried that he will continue to lie, to disregard norms and laws for his own gain and to be swayed by sycophants and dictators, to refuse to admit electoral defeat.</p>

<p>These are behaviors and attitudes that should be criticized as outside the bounds of normal politics. While the democrats are not paragons of virtue—leftist social dogma has certainly corrupted some of our institutions—there remains a bright line between Trump and his opponents. Lying remains stigmatized, releasing classified documents is not seen as your personal purview. Most importantly, no one believes that the democrats would refuse to ceade an election.</p>

<p>To say that tragedy has not yet struck, that democracy has not yet fallen, and conclude there is nothing to worry about is an irrational attitude to adopt. By this logic, one could never notice any warning signs for any possible problem. Perhaps we should refuse to consider [some obvious problems] as well. Democracies do not fall overnight, they are slowly eroded; the levers of criticism of slowly dismantled by self-interested strongmen.  Tragedy will not strike, it will unfold one norm violation at a time.</p>

<p>It’s easy to defend the tradition of criticism when it’s not under threat, just as
it’s easy to defend free speech when you the subversive opinion and easy to defend the right to protest when you support the cause. It’s easy to defend a strongman when you agree with his policies. The measure of any critical rationalist is whether they will defend the tradition of criticism even if promised your favorite policies to look the other way.</p>
