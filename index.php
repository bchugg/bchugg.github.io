			<h4>
				Hello! I have big ears and I'm addicted to podcasts. 
				I was much cuter as a child. 
			</h4>

			<h4>
				I'm currently an M.Sc. student at the <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a> 
				at <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford</a>. My research interests lie somewhere between stochastic networks, 
				biological computation and guiness, although I'm quickly falling in love with economics.  
			</h4>

			<h4>
				Previously, I spent some time at <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/">RIKEN AIP</a> 
				in Tokyo, where I was  lucky to work with <a href="http://www.prefield.com/index.html">Dr. Maehara</a> 
				as part of the <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/discr_optimize/">Discrete 
				Optimization Unit</a>. Here I spent most of my time confused about submodular stochastic optimization 
				problems. Prior to that, I spent several wonderful years at the  
			 	<a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a> studying mathematics and computer science.
			 	 While there, my time spent on research was split between being confused about 
			 	 stochastic chemical reaction networks 
			 	 and graph theory. I was immensely fortunate to be 
			 	 supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~will/">Will Evans</a> and  <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~condon/">Anne Condon</a>, 
			 	 who both abated my confusion on many occasions. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on computing in dynamic 
			 	 environments under uncertainty.
